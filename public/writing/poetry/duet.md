I'd be a tad sad for a lad going mad for you.  
 I'd be glad to add to your madness, lad!   
 Though it may be a fad, I'm no cad and will not make you sad.  
Dearest Darling, dang dapper discussion to deal down!   
A fad fits fools falling for feminine fatales!  
 True. A terriby transient thing, this tad madness!  
Won't you be mad with me darling?  
Fools fawning and frolicking through the fields of life?  
A summertime romance to be enjoyed?   
A kiss on the lips in a park, a hand held in mine in the dark.  
A twirl and a twist as our tango lifts us embraced.  
 I'll tango with you, for a month, maybe two.  
 We'll satisfy madness with laughter and gladness.   
 And then, when we part, for our lives lived apart  
 we'll savor the thought of those times that we knew.  
To touch and dance in sway, theres more than one way.  
Though oceans apart, a letter in flight may rise a glum day.  
Parted by choice, our lives may see.   
A day to return to the gladness we'll see.

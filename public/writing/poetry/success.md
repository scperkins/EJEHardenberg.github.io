Branch out. Spread thin.   
Why should I when I want to win?  
Well rounded, jack of all.  
Who cares when oppinions don't matter at all?  
Take by force, take with guile  
Take it all so long as you smile.   
Swelled with pride, aloof with vanity.  
Waiting to burst. In the mirror, what do you see?
